- a.1 Spark code brackdown to optimizer    
![Spark2_myLearning_inforGraphics](https://github.com/vivek-bombatkar/Spark-with-Python---My-learning-notes-/blob/master/pics/Spark2_myLearning_inforGraphics.jpg)


- a.2 pySpark ML pipeline breakdown   
![Spark2_ml pipeline](https://github.com/vivek-bombatkar/DataWorksSummit2018_Spark_ML/raw/master/pics/LogisticRegression_HashingTF_Tokenizer_text_parsing_pipeline.jpg)


- a.3 Action[1] --> Job[1]  --> Stages[n] --> Tasks[n]  
  - new ***job*** is created on ***actions***  
  - new ***stages*** will be create if there is ***data shuffle*** in job. I.e. dependency on output of first stage  
  - new ***tasks*** will be created based on ***number of partitions*** in RDD in cluster.  
``` python
rdd1 = sc.textFile("f1") #transformation - stage 1
rdd2 = sc.textFile("f2")  #transformation - stage 2
rdd3 = rdd1.join(rdd2) #transformation + shuffle - stage 3
rdd4 = rdd3.mapPartition() #transformation - stage 3
rdd5 = rdd4.filter() #transformation - stage 3
rdd5.collect() #actions - stage 3
```


- a.4 Spark Standalone Mode   
  - In addition to running on the Mesos or YARN cluster managers, Spark also provides a simple standalone deploy mode.   
```
./bin/spark-shell --master spark://IP:PORT
# URL of the master
```

- a.5 supervise flag to spark-submit    
  - In standalone cluster mode supports restarting your application automatically if it exited with non-zero exit code.  
  ``` spark-submit --supervise ... ```
  
- a.6 Dynamic Allocation  
  - https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html#dynamic-allocation
  - scales the ***number of executors*** registered with this application up and down based on the workload. 
  - ```spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled```  

- a.7 Speculative execution   
  - ```spark.speculation```	
  - If set to "true", if one or more tasks are running slowly in a stage, they will be re-launched.

- a.8 locality wait
  - ```spark.locality.wait```		
  - How long to wait to launch a data-local task before giving up and launching it on a less-local node.   
  - The same wait will be used to step through multiple locality levels (process-local, node-local, rack-local and then any).   
  - It is also possible to customize the waiting time for each level by setting spark.locality.wait.node, etc.   
  - You should increase this setting if your tasks are long and see poor locality, but the default usually works well.  

> a.10  Performance Tunning
- http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/tuning.html  
- when tuning a Spark application – most importantly, data serialization and memory tuning, CPU, network bandwidth, memory  
- Data Serialization:  
  - Formats that are slow to serialize objects into, or consume a large number of bytes, will greatly slow down the computation.  
  - Java serialization (default)  
  - Kryo serialization: SparkConf and calling conf.set("spark.serializer", "org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer").  
- Memory Tuning:   
  - the amount of memory used by your objects (you may want your entire dataset to fit in memory),   
  - the cost of accessing those objects  
  - the overhead of garbage collection (if you have high turnover in terms of objects).  
- Memory Management Overview :   
  - two categories: execution and storage.  
  - ***Execution memory refers to that used for computation in shuffles, joins, sorts and aggregations,   
  - ***Storage memory refers to that used for caching and propagating internal data across the cluster.***
  - When no execution memory is used, storage can acquire all the available memory and vice versa.  
  - ```spark.memory.fraction```  
  - ```spark.memory.storageFraction```  
  
- ***How Determining Memory Consumption***  
> https://github.com/vivek-bombatkar/spark-training/tree/master/spark-python/jupyter-advanced-caching  

  - create an RDD, put it into cache, and look at the “Storage” page in the web UI  
  - SizeEstimator’s estimate - consumption of a particular object  
  - With cache(), you use only the default storage level MEMORY_ONLY. With persist(), you can specify which storage level you want.
    - MEMORY_ONLY  
    - MEMORY_ONLY_SER  
    - MEMORY_AND_DISK  
    - MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER  
    - DISK_ONLY  
  
- Tuning Data Structures  
  - avoid the Java features that add overhead, such as pointer-based data structures and wrapper objects.   
  - prefer arrays of objects, and ***primitive types***, instead of the standard Java or Scala collection classes  
  - Avoid nested structures with a lot of small objects and pointers when possible.  
  - Consider using numeric IDs or ***enumeration objects*** instead of strings for keys.  

- Serialized RDD Storage  
  - When your objects are still too large to efficiently store despite this tuning, a much simpler way to reduce memory usage is to store them in serialized formt    
  - Downside is performance hit, as it add overhead of deserialization every time  

- Garbage Collection Tuning  

- ***Level of Parallelism***  
  -  Spark automatically sets the number of 
   - “map” tasks to run on each file according to its size (though you can control it through optional parameters to SparkContext.textFile, etc),   
   - and for distributed “reduce” operations, it uses the largest parent RDD’s number of partitions.   
  - ```spark.default.parallelism```   
  - recommend ***2-3 tasks per CPU core*** in your cluster.  
  - You can safely increase the level of parallelism to more than the number of cores in your clusters.  
  
 - ***Memory Usage of Reduce Tasks***
  -  Spark’s shuffle operations (sortByKey, groupByKey, reduceByKey, join, etc) build a ***hash table*** within each task to perform the grouping, which can often be large.  
  - The simplest fix here is to increase the level of parallelism, so that each task’s input set is smaller  
  
 - ***Broadcasting Large Variables***
   -  in general tasks larger than about 20 KB are probably worth optimizing.  
   
 - ***Data Locality***  
  > https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-apache-spark/spark-data-locality.html  
   - If data and the code that operates on it are together then computation tends to be fast   
   - Typically it is faster to ship serialized code from place to place than a chunk of data because code size is much smaller than data.     - Spark builds its scheduling around this general principle of data locality.  
   - Spark prefers to schedule all tasks at the best locality level, but this is not always possible.   
   - In situations where there is no unprocessed data on any idle executor, Spark switches to lower locality levels.   
   - There are two options:   
    - a) wait until a busy CPU frees up to start a task on data on the same server, or  
    - b) immediately start a new task in a farther away place that requires moving data there.  
   - What Spark typically does is wait a bit in the hopes that a busy CPU frees up.  
   - Once that timeout expires, it starts moving the data from far away to the free CPU.  
   - You should increase these settings if your tasks are long and see poor locality, but the default usually works well.  
   - The best means of checking whether a task ran locally is to inspect a given stage in the Spark UI.
   - In the Stages tab of spark UI ***Locality Level*** column displays which locality a given task ran with.
   - Locality Level : PROCESS_LOCAL, NODE_LOCAL, RACK_LOCAL, or ANY

  - https://techmagie.wordpress.com/2015/12/19/understanding-spark-partitioning/  
  - https://www.talend.com/blog/2018/03/05/intro-apache-spark-partitioning-need-know/  
    - Every node in a Spark cluster contains one or more partitions.  
    - too few (causing less concurrency, data skewing & improper resource utilization)   
    - too many (causing task scheduling to take more time than actual execution time)  
    - By default, it is set to the total number of cores on all the executor nodes.   
    - Partitions in Spark do not span multiple machines.  
    - Tuples in the same partition are guaranteed to be on the same machine.  
    - Spark assigns one task per partition and each worker can process one task at a time.  


### <a name="b"></a>b. WEB UI / Spark UI  
 > [spark web ui](https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-apache-spark/spark-webui.html)  
 > https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/5-9-x/topics/operation_spark_applications.html  

- A job can be in a running, succeeded, failed or unknown state.    
- ```JOBS --> STAGES --> TASKS```  

Below tabs from spark UI  

![data locality](https://github.com/vivek-bombatkar/MyLearningNotes/raw/master/spark/pics/spark_ui.JPG)

- 1. ***JOBS tab*** :  The Jobs tab consists of two pages, i.e. All Jobs and Details for Job pages.  
  
- 2. ***STAGES tab***:  
  - Stages tab in web UI shows the current state of 'all stages of all jobs' in a Spark application (i.e. a SparkContext)  
  - two optional pages for the tasks and statistics for a stage (when a stage is selected) and pool details (when the application works in FAIR scheduling mode).  
  - ***Summary Metrics***  :
    - for Completed Tasks in Stage : The summary metrics table shows the metrics for the tasks in a given stage that have already finished with SUCCESS status and metrics available.  
    - The table consists of the following columns: Metric, Min, 25th percentile, Median, 75th percentile, Max.  
  
- 3. ***STORAGE tab*** :   
  - When created, StorageTab creates the following pages and attaches them immediately: A. StoragePage B.RDDPage   
  - All Stages Page:  shows the task details for a stage given its id and attempt id.   
  - Stagev Details page / The Fair Scheduler Pool Details page :  shows information about a Schedulable pool and is only available when a Spark application uses the FAIR scheduling mode (which is controlled by spark.scheduler.mode setting).    
    
- 4. ***ENVIRONMENT tab***: Shows various details like total tasks, Input, Shuffle read & write, etc  
  
- 5. ***EXECUTORS tab*** : list all executors used   
    - Input - total data processed or read by the application from hadoop or spark storage  
    - Storage Memory - tatal memory used or available     
    
- 6. ***SQL tab***:  SQL tab in web UI shows SQLMetrics per physical operator in a structured query physical plan.  
    - By default, it displays all SQL query executions.  
    - However, after a query has been selected, the SQL tab displays the details for the structured query execution

### <a name="1"></a>Introduction to Data Analysis with Spark    
- cluster computing platform   
- Spark application consists of a driver program that launches various parallel operations on a cluster.   
- driver programs typically manage a number of nodes called executors
- ***SparkContext*** represents a connection to a computing cluster.  
 
<img src="https://github.com/vivek-bombatkar/MyLearningNotes/blob/master/spark/pics/componunt_distribution_spark.JPG" />

### <a name="2"></a>Programming with RDDs    
- Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD)
- an immutable distributed collection of objects
- It split into multiple partitions, which may be computed on different nodes of the cluster
- ***Transformations*** construct a new RDD from a previous one.
- ***Actions***, on the other hand, compute a result based on an RDD, and either return it to the driver program or save it to an external storage system
- lazy evaluation  - Spark only computes them in a lazy fashion
- to reuse an RDD in multiple actions, you can ask Spark to persist it using RDD.persist().
-  three options for passing functions into Spark - lambda. top level function or locally define functions
- reduce / fold

### <a name="3"></a>Working with Key-Value Pairs
- RDDs containing key-value pairs. These RDDs are called Pair RDDs. 
- Transformations one pair rdd : reduceByKey / foldByKey, combineByKey, countByValue, groupByKey, mapValues, flatMapValues, keys, values, sortByKey
- Transformations on two pair rdd : substractByKey, join, rightOuterJoin, leftOuterJoin, cogroup
- Actions : collectAsMap(), lookup()
- Most operator accept a second parameter giving the number of partitions to use when creating the grouped or aggregated RDD
- repartitioning your data is a fairly expensive operation
- Partitioning will not be helpful in all applications — for example, if a given RDD is only scanned once, there is no point in partitioning it in advance. It is only useful when a dataset is reused multiple times in key-oriented operations such as joins. 
- ***partitionBy***
- HashPartitioner

### <a name="4"></a>Loading and Saving Your Data
- Comprassion optison : gzip, lzo, bzip2, zlib, Snappy
-  

### <a name="5"></a>Advanced Spark Programming
- ***accumulators*** to aggregate information.
- One of the most common uses of accumulators is to count events that occur during job execution for debugging purposes. 
- Note that tasks on worker nodes cannot access the accumulator’s value — from the point of view of these tasks, accumulators are write-only variables.
- ***speculative execution*** Spark can preemptivley launch a “speculative” copy of the task on another node, and take its result if that finishes.
- accumulators updated in actions vs in transformations
- broadcast variables to efficiently distribute large values. allow the program to efficiently send a large, read-only value to all the worker nodes for use in one or more Spark operations.
- ***PrePartition operations***: mapPartition, foreachPartition, mapPartitionWithIndex

### <a name="6"></a>Running on a Cluster
- When running in cluster mode, Spark utilizes a master-slave architecture with one central coordinator and many distributed workers. 
- The central coordinator is called the driver. 
- The driver communicates with potentially larger number of distributed workers called executors. 
- The driver runs in its own Java process and each executor is a Java process. 
- A driver and its executors are together termed a Spark application.
- A Spark application is launched on a set of machines using an external service called a cluster manager.
- Driver program main duties : 
    - a. compiling user program into task
    - b. scheduling task on executor
- Executor 
    - a. running the tasks
    - b. in-memory storage for rdd
- Sparks Dirver & Executor VS YARNs Master & Worker
    - For instance Apache YARN runs a master daemon (called the Resource Manager) and several worker daemons called (Node Managers). 
    - Spark will run both drivers and executors on YARN worker nodes.
- spark2-submit options types :
    - The first is the location of the cluster manager along with an amount of resources you’d like to request for your job (as shown above). 
    - The second is information about the runtime dependencies of your application, such as libraries or files you want to be present on all worker machines.
    
 
 
## <a name="42"></a>4.2 High Performance Spark - Holden Karau and Rachel Warren   


### Spark Model of Parallel Computing: RDDs
- driver (or master node) perform operations on data in parallel. 
- Spark represents large datasets as RDDs, immutable distributed collections of objects, 
- which are stored in the executors or (slave nodes). 
- The objects that comprise RDDs are called partitions 
- Partitions may be (but do not need to be) computed on different nodes of a distributed system. 
- Spark can keep an RDD loaded in memory on the executor nodes throughout the life of a Spark application for faster access 
- RDDs are immutable, so transforming an RDD returns a new RDD rather than the existing one.
-  Actions trigger the scheduler, which builds a directed acyclic graph (called the DAG), based on the dependencies between RDD transformations. 
- Then, using this series of steps called the execution plan, the scheduler computes the missing partitions for each stage until it computes the whole RDD.  

### In Memory Storage and Memory Management  
- Spark offers three options for memory management:  
  - in memory deserialized data  - higher performace but consume high memory   
  - in memory as serialized data - slower performance but low disk space  
  - on disk - slower and nothing in memory, can be more fault tolarent for long string transformations  
- The persist() function in the RDD class lets the user control how the RDD is stored. 
- By default, persist() stores an RDD as deserialized objects in memory.  

### five main properties to represent an RDD internally. 
- partitions()  
- iterator(p, parentIters)  
- dependencies()  
- partitioner()  
- preferredLocations(p)  

### Resource Allocation Across Applications  
-  static allocation  
-  dynamic allocation  

### The Anatomy of a Spark Job  
> https://github.com/vivek-bombatkar/spark-training/tree/master/spark-python/jupyter-advanced-execution   

> spark application -> jobs -> stages -> tasks  


- ***jobs*** 
  - highest element of Spark’s execution hierarchy. 
  - Each Spark job corresponds to one action
- ***stages***
  - As mentioned above, a job is defined by calling an action. 
  - The action may include several transformations, which breakdown of jobs into stages.
  - Several transformations with narrow dependencies can be grouped into one stage.
  - It is possible to executed stages in parallel if they are used to compute different RDDs
  - wide transformations needed to compute one RDD have to be computed in sequence
  - one stage can be computed without moving data across the partitions. 
  - Within one stage, the tasks are the units of work done for each partition of the data.
- ***tasks***
  - A stage consists of tasks. 
  - The task is the smallest unit in the execution hierarchy
  - each can represent one local computation. 
  - One task cannot be executed on more than one executor. 
  - However, each executor has a dynamically allocated number of slots for running tasks
  - The number of tasks per stage corresponds to the number of partitions in the output RDD of that stage.
 
 > Spark SQL’s column operators are defined on the column class, so a filter containing the expression 0 >= df.col("friends") will not
compile since Scala will use the >= defined on 0. Instead you would write df.col("friend") <= 0 or convert 0 to a column literal with
lit  

- ***Transformations*** : types
  - filters
  - sql standard functions
  - 'when' - for if then else
  - Specialized DataFrame Transformations for Missing & Noisy Data
  - Beyond Row-by-Row Transformations
  - Aggregates and groupBy - agg API
  - windowing
  - sorting - orderBy
  - Multi DataFrame Transformations
  
- Tungsten  
  - Tungsten is a new Spark SQL component that provides more efficient Spark operations by working directly at the byte level.
  - Tungsten includes specialized in-memory data structures tuned for the type of operations required by Spark
  - improved code generation, and a specialized wire protocol.

- Query Optimizer  
  - Catalyst is the Spark SQL query optimizer, 
  - which is used to take the query plan and transform it into an execution plan that Spark can run. 
  - Much as our transformations on RDDs build up a DAG, Spark SQL builds up a tree representing our query plan, called a logical plan. 
  - Spark is able to apply a number of optimizations on the logical plan 
  - also choose between multiple physical plans for the same logical plan using a cost-based mode.
  
### Joins (SQL & Core) 
 
- In order to join data, Spark needs the data that is to be joined to live on the same partition. 
- The default implementation of join in Spark is a shuffled hash join. 
- Shuffel could be avoided if 
  - 1. ***Both RDDs have a known partitioner.***  
  - 2. map side join -One of the datasets is small enough to fit in memory, in which case we can do a broadcast hash join 
- ***Left semi joins***
  - are the only kind of join which only has values from the left table. 
  - A left semi join is the same as filtering the left table for only rows with keys present in the right table.
  - ```df1.join(df2, df1("name") === df2("name"), "leftsemi")```
- ***Broadcast Hash Joins***
  - df1.join(broadcast(df2), "key")
  - Spark also automatically uses the spark.sql.conf.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold to determine if a table should be broadcast.

### Passing Functions to Spark
- There are three recommended ways to do this:
  - Lambda expressions. Lambdas do not support multi-statement functions or statements that do not return a value.)
  - Local defs inside the function calling into Spark, for longer code.
  - Top-level functions in a module.
  - method in a class instance (as opposed to a singleton object), this requires sending the object that contains that class along with the method.
  - 
 
### Lading any external files to spark dataframe : spark.read.load / spark.read
```python
df_json = spark.read.load("FILE_LOCATION.json",format="json)
df_csv = spark.read.load("FILE_LOCATION.csv", format="csv", sep=",", inferSchema = "true", header = "true")
df_parquet = spark.read.parquet("FILE_LOCATION.parquet")
df_jdbc = spark.read \
    .format("jdbc") \
    .option("url", "jdbc:postgresql:dbserver") \
    .option("dbtable", "schema.tablename") \
    .option("user", "username") \
    .option("password", "password") \
    .load()
```

### Writing data to external : sdf.write.save & write.option("path":"DIR_LOCATION").saveAsTable("tble1")
- .saveAsTable("tble1") : For file-based data source, e.g. text, parquet, json, etc. you can specify a custom table path via the path option. When the table is dropped, the custom table path will not be removed and the table data is still there.  
```python
sdf.write.parquet("DIR_LOCATION")
sdf.write.save(FILE_LOCATION.parquet)
```

- ***partitionBy*** creates a directory structure as described in the Partition Discovery section. columns with ***high cardinality***. 
- ***bucketBy*** distributes data across a fixed number of buckets and can be used when a number of unique values is unbounded.  

```python
df.write
    .partitionBy("favorite_color")
    .bucketBy(42, "name")
    .saveAsTable("people_partitioned_bucketed")
```


### Schema Merging
- Like ProtocolBuffer, Avro, and Thrift, Parquet also supports schema evolution. Users can start with a simple schema, and gradually add more columns to the schema as needed.   
- In this way, users may end up with multiple Parquet files with different but mutually compatible schemas.   
- The Parquet data source is now able to automatically detect this case and merge schemas of all these files.   

```python
spark.read.option("mergeSchema", "true").parquet("FOLDER_LOCATION")
```
### Parquet Files
- Parquet is a columnar format that is supported by many other data processing systems.   
- Spark SQL provides support for both reading and writing Parquet files that automatically preserves the schema of the original data.  
- When writing Parquet files, all columns are automatically converted to be nullable for compatibility reasons.  

#### HIVE vs Parquet
- Hive is case insensitive, while Parquet is not  
- Hive considers all columns nullable, while nullability in Parquet is significant  

### Best way to load data from URL to spark - Pandas
```python
#Example to load csv
import pandas as pd
sdf = spark.createDataFrame(pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/airline-safety/airline-safety.csv"))
```
 
### Pandas in spark  
> https://github.com/vivek-bombatkar/spark-training/tree/master/spark-python/jupyter-advanced-udf   
- Scalar Pandas UDFs are used for vectorizing scalar operations. 
- They can be used with functions such as select and withColumn
- toPandas() will convert the Spark DataFrame into a Pandas DataFrame, which is of course in memory.  
```python
def multi_fun(a, b):
  return a * b

x = pd.Series([1,2,3,4])
multi = pandas_udf(multi_fun,returnType=LongType())
sdf= spark.createDataFrame(pd.DataFrame(x, columns=["x"]))
sdf.select(multi(col("x"),col("x"))).show()
```

### Grouped Map on Pandas df : Split-apply-combine  
- Grouped map Pandas UDFs are used with groupBy().apply() which implements the “split-apply-combine” pattern.   
- Split-apply-combine consists of three steps:  
  - Split the data into groups by using DataFrame.groupBy.  
  - Apply a function on each group. The input data contains all the rows and columns for each group.  
  - Combine the results into a new DataFrame.  
```python  
from pyspark.sql.functions import  pandas_udf, PandasUDFType

sdf_grp = spark.createDataFrame([(1,10),(2,10),(3,30)],("id","v"))

@pandas_udf("id integer, v double", PandasUDFType.GROUPED_MAP)
def fun_1(pdf):
  v = pdf.v
  return pdf.assign(v = v - v.mean())

sdf_grp.groupBy("id").apply(fun_1).show()
```

### Arrow : JVM to Python data xfer 
- Apache Arrow is an in-memory columnar data format.  
- that is used in Spark to efficiently transfer data between JVM and Python processes  
- good  with Pandas/NumPy data.   
- PyArrow - pip install pyspark[sql]  
- ***‘spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled’ to ‘true’  

### NaN
- There is specially handling for not-a-number (NaN)
- when dealing with float or double types that does not exactly match standard floating point semantics.


 
 
 ## <a name="50"></a>5. SPARKSESSION & PYSPARK.SQL.FUNCTIONS f   
 > http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/api/python/pyspark.sql.html  
 - functions could be passed to API to perform operations  
 - like aggregate functions used with 'agg' API  
 
 ```python
 from pyspark.sql import functions f
 ```
 
 ### lit() 
 Creates a Column of literal value
 ```python
 df.withColumn("col1", f.when("col2") == 0, f.lit("Y")).otherwise(f.lit("N")))
 ```  
 ### monotonically_increasing_id() 
 A column that generates monotonically increasing 64-bit integers. monotonically increasing and unique, but not consecutive.
```python
df.withColumn("new_id", f.monotonically_increasing_id())
```
### SparkSession.table()
Returns the specified table as a DataFrame.

### expr()
Parses the expression string into the column that it represents
```python
col_condn = f.exppr("if(col is null, 1,0)") 
df.withColumn("col1",col_condn)
```

### JOIN 
> http://www.learnbymarketing.com/1100/pyspark-joins-by-example/  
> https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.0/api/python/pyspark.sql.html  
> https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.0/api/python/_modules/pyspark/sql/dataframe.html#DataFrame.join  
```python
df_res = df_one.join(df_two,df_one.col1 == df_two.col1,"left") 
df_res = df_one.join(other=df_two,on=["col1"],how="left")
df_res = df_one.alias("a").join(df_two.alias("b"),col("a.col1") == col("b.col1"),"left") 
```
- (inner, outer, left_outer, right_outer, leftsemi)   
- Join takes three parameters: DataFrame on the right side of the join, Which fields are being joined on, and what type of join 
-  An ***inner join*** is the default join type used 
- default ``inner``. Must be one of: ``inner``, ``cross``, ``outer``,
            ``full``, ``full_outer``, ``left``, ``left_outer``, ``right``, ``right_outer``,
            ``left_semi``, and ``left_anti``  
- ‘leftsemi’ if you care only for the left columns and just want to pull in the records that match in both table A and table B, y  
- 


### distinct()
>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30959955/how-does-distinct-function-work-in-spark
- shuffle data accross partition 
```

```
 
### dataFrame.checkpoint
> https://dzone.com/articles/what-are-spark-checkpoints-on-dataframes  
> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35127720/what-is-the-difference-between-spark-checkpoint-and-persist-to-a-disk  
- Returns a checkpointed version of this dataset. 
- Checkpointing can be used to ***truncate the logical plan of this dataset***, which is especially useful in iterative algorithms where the plan may grow exponentially. 
- It will be saved to files inside the checkpoint directory set with  SparkContext#setCheckpointDir.
- types : Eager Checkpoint & Non-Eager Checkpoint
 - eager – Whether to checkpoint this DataFrame immediately
```python
df.checkpoint
```

### pyspark.sql.window
> https://databricks.com/blog/2015/07/15/introducing-window-functions-in-spark-sql.html  
> Example: https://github.com/vivek-bombatkar/spark-training/tree/master/spark-python/jupyter-advanced-windows  
```python
window_condn = window \
               .partitionby(df.col_date) \               
               .rangeBetween(min_val, max_val) \
               .rowsBetween(Window.unboundedPreceding, Window.unboundedFollowing) \
               .OrderBy(df.col_date) 

df_new = df.withColumn('col1',f.sum('col2')).over(window_condn)   
```

### df.pivote
> https://databricks.com/blog/2016/02/09/reshaping-data-with-pivot-in-apache-spark.html  
> Example: https://github.com/vivek-bombatkar/spark-training/tree/master/spark-python/jupyter-advanced-pivoting  

- Pivots a column of the current DataFrame and perform the specified aggregation. 
- There are two versions of pivot function: one that requires the caller to specify the list of distinct values to pivot on, and one that does not. 
- The latter is more concise but less efficient, because Spark needs to first compute the list of distinct values internally.

### f.explode(col)
Returns a new row for each element in the given array or map.
```python
new_df = df.select(f.explode(df.col1))
```

### df.groupBy(*cols)
Groups the DataFrame using the specified columns, so we can run aggregation on them. See GroupedData for all the available aggregate functions.
```python
df.groupBy(df.col1).count().collect()
```

### df.agg(*expr)
Aggregate on the entire DataFrame without groups (shorthand for df.groupBy.agg()).
```python
df.groupBy(df.col1).agg(a.max(df.col1))
```
- get non groupby cols in df  
```python

pyspark.sql.functions import collect_set
df.groupBy(df.col1).agg(a.collect_set(df.col2))

col1  collect_set(col2)
1     [2,3]
5     [7,9]
```

### pyspark.sql.types.ArrayType
```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import udf
@udf(returnType=ArrayType(StringType()))
def func_test_udf(a):
   return []
 
 new_df = df.withColumn("new_col", func_test_udf(df.col1))

An error occurred while calling None.org.apache.spark.sql.execution.python.UserDefinedPythonFunction. Trace:
class org.apache.spark.sql.types.ArrayType]) does not exist
```

### df.filter()
```python
df_new = df.filter(col("col1").isNotNull & col("col1") > 100)
```

### f.first(col)
Aggregate function: returns the first value in a group.

### df.distinct()
```python
df.select("abc").distinct()
```

### add / remove cols
```python
sdf.withColumn("new_col",lit(1))

sdf.drop("new_col)
```

### eqNullSafe
-  include NULL values in the join  
```python
sdf_1.join(sdf_2,sdf_1.col_1.eqNullSafe(sdf_2.col_1))
```

### RDD , partition , tasks etc..
> https://qubole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/217111026-Reference-Relationship-between-Partitions-Tasks-Cores

- ```# of Spark RDD / Data Frame Partitions = Result of Partitioning Logic for Spark Function```

- For the first task this is driven by the number of files in the source:
    ```# of Tasks required for Stage = # of Source Partitions```

- For the subsequent tasks this is driven by the number of partitions from the prior stages:
    ```# of Tasks required for Stage = # of Spark RDD / Data Frame Partitions```
